	<h1>Charlotte Hannah</h1>
	<p>Hi! I’m Charlotte from Cardiff. I'm 22 and in my final year at the University of Bath studying Mathematics. In my first year I climbed Kilimanjaro for charity, and then spent a few weeks exploring Tanzania, which was an incredible experience and got me hooked on travelling! Since then the countries I've travelled to include United Emirates, Russia, United States, Norway, Austria, Slovenia and The Netherlands.</p>

	<h2>Victoria Duley</h2>
<p>Hi! 

	I’m Victoria, I’m 18 years old and I am currently in my second year at the University of Bath. I study Politics with Economics, and I am a generally upbeat, enthusiast and curious girl. I’m originally French but I chose to study in the UK because I love interacting with different cultures and meeting new people because it broadens my horizons. Speaking of which, travelling is probably my favourite thing. I’m lucky to have been to all 5 continents, by myself, with my family or friends. 

	So here is the list! Each trip involves so many discoveries, memories, I couldn’t rank them. 

	Brazil 
	Peru 
	Guatemala
	Cuba 
	US- NYC, Atlanta
	South Africa 
	Egypt 
	Morocco 
	Europe
	Vietnam 
	Bali 
	Hong Kong 
	Australia
